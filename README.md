# Duy's Cookiecutter Template

## Usage
You need to have cookiecutter installed (using the [official installation instructions](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) or [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cookiecutter)) to use this template.

and follow the prompts.

## Development
### Configuring whitespace
This [web page](https://j2live.ttl255.com/) is useful for visualizing Jinja2 rendered whitespace. Just add `{ "cookiecutter": <cookiecutter.json content> } to the Jinja2 data field.
